									<span>In haste this great Parnassus to possess</span>

									<span>And Delphi, thronèd in the wilderness.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And with him came, to escort him and revere,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A folk born of Hephaistos, pioneer</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of God’s way, making sweet a bitter land.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And much this people and the King whose hand</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Then steered them, Delphos, glorified his name,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Till Zeus into his heart put mystic flame</span>

									<span>Yon old Corycian bird-belovèd steep,</span>

									<span>Deep-caverned, where things blessèd come and go.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And Bromios walks the mountain, well I know,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Since first he led his Maenad host on high</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And doomed King Pentheus like a hare to die.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8" id="noteref-8" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>

									<span>Ah! Horrors, horrors, dire to speak or see,</span>

									<span>From Loxias’ chamber drive me reeling back.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>My knees are weak beneath me, and I lack</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The strength to fly.⁠ ⁠… O hands, drag me from here</span>
									<br/>
									<span>If feet fail!⁠ ⁠… An old woman, and in fear,</span>

									<span>A thing of naught, a babe in helplessness!</span>

									<span>A man abhorred of God, his body hurled</span>

									<span>Earthward in desperate prayer; blood on his hand<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-9" id="noteref-9" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
									<br/>

									<br/>
									<span>Wreathed in beseeching wool, a suppliant’s weed</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of snow-white fleece⁠ ⁠… so much mine eyes could read.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But out in front of him a rout unknown</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of women sleepeth, flung from throne to throne.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Women? Nay, never women! Gorgons more:</span>
									<br/>

									<br/>
									<span>Their garb, it is no garb to show before</span>
									<br/>
									<span>God’s altar nor the hearths of human kind.</span>
									<br/>
